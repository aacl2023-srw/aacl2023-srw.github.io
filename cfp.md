# Call for Papers

## General Rules for Submission

The AACL-IJCNLP 2023 Student Research Workshop (SRW) provides a forum for student researchers who are investigating various areas related to Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for student participants to present their work and receive valuable feedback from the international research community as well as from selected panelists - experienced researchers, specifically assigned according to the topic of their work, who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

The workshop's goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education: including undergraduate, masters, junior and senior PhD students.

We invite papers in three different categories:

- **General Research Papers**: Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. For these papers, the first author must be a current graduate or undergraduate student. Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as the AACL-IJCNLP 2023 main conference. See the list of topics [here](http://www.ijcnlp-aacl2023.org/) (under Calls -> Main Papers -> Submission Topics).
- **Thesis Proposals**: This category is appropriate for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.
- **SPECIAL THEME NEED TO DECIDE**
<!-- - **Human-Centered NLP** : This is the special theme category in AACL-SRW 2022. The rising prevalence of living along with artificial intelligence has brought lots of benefits to people's daily life. However, it also poses a challenge of building reliable, explainable, and empathic tools to provide better service, from essential natural language applications (e.g., machine translation, text classification ) to mental support. Especially during the current pandemic, people are more likely to feel alone and _rely_ upon _technology_. This, together with the advances in the field of Natural Language processing, has motivated the exploration of human-centered technology. In this special theme, we invite submissions that address diverse human-centered questions, particularly encouraging bringing together perspectives and methods from NLP and affective computing to improve individuals' lives physically and mentally.
  Topics of interest include ( but are not limited to):
  (1) affective systems to understand human emotion and respond to their emotional feedback
  (2) sentiment analysis in social media, e-commerce data, etc.
  (3) human factors in the NLP evaluation system
  (4) reliable and explainable NLP models
  (5) ethics in NLP, including debiasing, detoxification, etc. -->

## Benefits of participation

- All accepted papers will be presented in the main conference poster session, giving students an opportunity to interact with and present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field.
- All accepted thesis proposals will be presented during a session at the main conference, giving students an opportunity to receive feedback from assigned mentors and other researchers.
- Submissions (in both categories) may either be archival or non-archival, based on the wishes of the authors. All archival papers will be published in the AACL-IJCNLP 2023 SRW Proceedings. All non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future **except** another SRW.
- Each participant is also assigned a mentor - an experienced researcher - who can provide valuable advice on the submission during the pre-submission period and mentoring during the conference.
- We are also planning on having an invited speaker who will share his/her perspectives on NLP research.
