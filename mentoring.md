# Mentoring

## Pre-submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to get feedback in advance to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the studentâ€™s work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged and pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.
Students wishing to participate must submit the paper by **Aug 4, 2023** to the START conference system: [https://softconf.com/ijcnlp2023/SRW2023/](https://softconf.com/ijcnlp2023/SRW2023/). If you choose to participate in the pre-submission mentorship program, remember to **select the "Yes" option in the button for Pre-submission mentorship** on the submission page.

Note that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be **anonymized**. We will check for formality of the paper including formatting before we match mentors.

Participants will receive a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student within 2-3 weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.
